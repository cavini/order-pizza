  // as much as it breaks my heart to use an any as the return type, specially for an official react-router-dom hook, I have no other choice but to use it here
  // since using "@typescript-eslint/no-implicit-any-catch" is not recommended because the rule is deprecated, and should be available out of the box with typescript >= 4.0.0
  // but it doesnt. Tried adding useUnknownInCatchVariables in my tsconfig file but it does not work.
  // Also had to add "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any" to my typescript config file, which is something that I never do, because it was bouncing back and forth between errors with any and unknown.
